# Text Mining
In this project I have created a document search engine using cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectors. In essence, the program will search for documents based on relavency to
the search query. It does not directly search for matching text. Each document is checked for its 'similarity' to the user specified search query. The project is annotated
and can be followed along in the .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebooks).
